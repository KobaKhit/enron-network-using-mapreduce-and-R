ina rangel	john j lavorato	2001-02-21 03:05:00	re: fw: change in the agroup cycling schedule	  john,  does next thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts?  i will set up a room with kim.  here are some suggestions for projects for colleen:  1.  review and document systems and processes  -   the handoffs from erms, tagg, unify, sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements.  i think i understand erms and tagg but the issues facing scheduling in unify are grey.  2.  review and audit complex deals- under the "assume it is messed up" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further      scrutiny.  3.  review risk books-  is enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  lead trading track program-  recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  fundamentals- liason between trading and analysts.  are we looking at everything we should?  putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group.   in fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second md to work part time to get it done.  phillip

phillip k allen	frank hayden	2000-09-11 02:19:00	re: sagewood etc.	  why is aeco basis so low on the list?  is nwpl mapped differently than aeco?

phillip k allen	frank hayden	2000-11-01 03:34:00	re:	  frank,  the implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  if the var calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

phillip k allen	jacquestc@aol.com @ enron	2000-10-31 04:44:00	re: astral downtime request	  jacques,  the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit "b" are as follows:  kipp flores-total contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding.  kohutek- $2,150  cuatro- $37,800   george & larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount.  the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    i couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.  let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed.  phillip  

phillip k allen	jacquestc@aol.com @ enron	2001-02-20 01:09:00	re: draw2.xls	  jaques,  after meeting with george and larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit.  their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.  then there is a layer of "construction management" fees of 10%.  there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  but i think the majority of it is profit.  finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.  keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  after all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don't think the construction management fee is included.  george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  i will review and let you know what i think.  the gp issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.  let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for  only true costs + 1.4 million.  phillip

phillip k allen	jacquestc@aol.com @ enron	2001-03-26 02:03:00	current gas desk list	  jacques,  the agreement looks fine.   my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project".   technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required.  did i loan them $1,300,000?  i thought it was less.  regarding exhibit a, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  i have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

(if the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing, but anyway, here are the deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 139195  from kingsgate to malin     ($182,030) 139196 from kingsgate to pgen/tuscarora   ($    4,024) 139197  from kingsgate to pgen malin    ($    8,271) 231321  from kingsgate to malin     ($  38,705) 153771 from kingsgate to stanfield    ($     1,988) suggested fix:  change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to gdp-kingsgate.  clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  clay basin is valued as a questar curve, which is substantially below nwpl points.  what this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. i'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals.  in an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  anyway, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin.  there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but i thought i'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.  the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&l associated with each.  deal #  251327                  159540                   265229 106300   201756 p&l  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199) ($2,769)   ($273) rec:   ques/clay basin/0184   nwpl/opal 543  nwpl/opal   sumas      nwpl/s of gr rvr del:   nwpl/s of green river/clay   ques/clay basin/0852   ques/clay basin/0852   ques/clay basin    ques/clay basin 1        329       8,738 2     1,500 3         2,974    11,362 4         6,741    12,349       1,439 5       19,052          3,183 9            333 13  30,863       2,680 14  30,451 15  35,226 16         6,979              235 17  17,464 18    9,294 20  10,796          771 21  17,930 22  10,667 23       14,415          9,076 25  23,934       8,695 26     3,284 27         1,976 28     1,751 29     1,591 30  20,242

phillip k allen	"jeff smith" <jsmith@austintx.com> @ enron	2001-01-30 23:14:00	highlights of executive summary by kpmg -- cpuc audit report on	  jeff,  before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.  1.  operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.  2.  what is an outside management firm going to do?  a full time onsite manager is all that is required.  as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.  3.  considering #1 & #2 $115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated.  if you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  getting cash out is not a priority to me.  so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  a 10% note actually attractive. see below.  my job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.   sales price  705,000  1st lien   473,500  2nd lien  225,000  transfer fee    7,500  cash required   14,500   noi   100,000  1st lien    47,292  2nd lien   23,694  cash flow  29,014  cash on cash  200%   these numbers are using the conservative noi, if it comes in at $115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   this doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.  do you want to reconsider?  let me know.  phillip

richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 pm please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: "phillip allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "larry lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "claudia l. crocker" <clclegal2@aol.com> subject: investment structure   structure: typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner.  the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  phasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind?  i would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?"  please expand.  investor input we are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested.  i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.  sincerely,  george richards president, creekside builders, llc     - winmail.dat

ab 8x and ab 31x.  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  this bill passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support.  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x.  senator  bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy).  according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund.  for instance, tony  strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday.  additionally, lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.  key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount: $4.125 b lenders:  jp morgan  $2.5 b lehman brothers  $1.0 b bear stearns  $625 m tax exempt portion: of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt projected interest rate: taxable rate  5.77% tax-exempt rate  4.77% current projected blended ir:  5.38% maturity date:  august 29, 2001 for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority.    the $5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  again, the republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power.    also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the california public power and conservation authority.  however, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis.  socal edison and bankruptcy at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy.  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor.  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it.  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass.  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  in other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy.  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments.

richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 pm please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: "phillip allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "larry lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "claudia l. crocker" <clclegal2@aol.com> subject: investment structure   structure: typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner.  the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  phasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind?  i would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?"  please expand.  investor input we are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested.  i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.  sincerely,  george richards president, creekside builders, llc     - winmail.dat

phillip k allen	lkuch@mh.com	2000-08-23 08:22:00	re: you game?	  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/28/2000 01:09 pm ---------------------------    from:  phillip k allen                           09/28/2000 10:56 am    liane,  as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index.  it appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas.  at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan.  we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27.  these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon).  please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships.  the two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily.  it doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different.   i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.  it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal.  sincerely,  phillip allen

(one suggestion might be a permanent it person on this book.)

phillip k allen	mike.grigsby@enron.com	2001-01-22 00:38:00	re: please respond	  lucy,  here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.  did we collect these overages?  let's discuss further?  remember these bills were paid in july and august.  the usage dates are much earlier.  i have the bills but i can get them to you if need be.   by steve everly - the kansas city star date: 01/20/01 22:15  as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number.  the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.  "traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said william burson, a trader. "it makes the market for natural gas."  but the market's response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association's director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality.  "it's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting," mcgill said.  as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street.  stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices.  "it's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly.  in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.  closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes.  most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared.  "we're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy.  but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.  "there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change," said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass.   hot topic  consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in many circles, little else is discussed.  the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous december's bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as well.  the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.  "it's the talk of the town here," he said.  a year ago that wasn't a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers.  but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter.  there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.  but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets.  "it's all about the weather," said krapels of energy security analysis.  wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world.   setting the price  in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices.  the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use.  there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas.  but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time.  as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers.  utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter.  going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.  still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.  then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the association's mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage.  but some utility executives didn't share that view. william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december's cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.  "i was getting worried," he said.  then suddenly the market turned when january's weather turned warmer. wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.   just passing through  some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers.  among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday.  sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy.  kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter.  missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.  now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs.  on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy's gas purchasing practices.

denne/corp/enron@enron cc: subject: meeting with governor davis, need for additional comments/suggestions  we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la.  in attendance were ken lay, the governor, the governor's staff director (kari dohn) and myself.  the gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday. attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared.  below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:  overview:   we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  his staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw).  he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. our proposals:  i have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases.   as already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. his ideas:  the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". some of these ideas would require legislative action. state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants.  the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  this was a frequently recurring theme. utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california. state universities (including uc/csu and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. expand in-state gas production. take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here). wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. securitize uncollected power purchase costs. to dos: (jeff, again i'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday. he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. thanks to everyone for their help.  we made some progress today.

executive summary of the kpmg aud= it=20 report on southern california edison: =20 i. cash needs highlights: sce=01,s original cash forecast, dated as december 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of february 1, 2001. since then sce has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, sce=01,s=20 available cash improved through january 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. the actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. ii. credit relationships highlights: sce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. at present, there are no additional sources of credit open to sce. sce=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. sce=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. credit ratings agencies have downgraded sce=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. iii. energy cost scenarios highlights this report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon sce=01,s projected cash depletion dates. under= such=20 scenarios, sce would have a positive cash balance until march 30, 2001. iv. cost containment initiatives highlights sce has adopted a $460 million cost reduction plan for the year 2001. the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 capital improvement costs                383 total                                             $ 460 the plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. under the plan, capital improvement costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery (tra and tcba=20 activity) highlights: as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an overcollected balance in the=20 transition cost balancing account (tcba) account of $494.5 million. this=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an undercollected balance in sce=01,s= =20 transition account (tra) of $4.49 billion. normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th= e=20 end of each year. however, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the tcba, pursuant to=20 d.01-01-018. costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the tra, are overstated. turn proposal as part of our review, the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu= rn=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 our comments are summarized as follows: the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. the proposal=01,s impact on sce=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. turn=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the tra is overstated. vi. flow of funds analysis highlights: in the last five years, sce had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. during the same time period, sce paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, edison international, of approximately $4.8 billion. edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no section vii] =20 viii. earnings of california affiliates sce=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 in 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 this increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. a copy of the report is available on the commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 dan

executive summary of the kpmg aud= it=20 report on southern california edison: =20 i. cash needs highlights: sce=01,s original cash forecast, dated as december 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of february 1, 2001. since then sce has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, sce=01,s=20 available cash improved through january 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. the actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. ii. credit relationships highlights: sce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. at present, there are no additional sources of credit open to sce. sce=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. sce=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. credit ratings agencies have downgraded sce=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. iii. energy cost scenarios highlights this report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon sce=01,s projected cash depletion dates. under= such=20 scenarios, sce would have a positive cash balance until march 30, 2001. iv. cost containment initiatives highlights sce has adopted a $460 million cost reduction plan for the year 2001. the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 capital improvement costs                383 total                                             $ 460 the plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. under the plan, capital improvement costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery (tra and tcba=20 activity) highlights: as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an overcollected balance in the=20 transition cost balancing account (tcba) account of $494.5 million. this=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an undercollected balance in sce=01,s= =20 transition account (tra) of $4.49 billion. normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th= e=20 end of each year. however, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the tcba, pursuant to=20 d.01-01-018. costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the tra, are overstated. turn proposal as part of our review, the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu= rn=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 our comments are summarized as follows: the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. the proposal=01,s impact on sce=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. turn=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the tra is overstated. vi. flow of funds analysis highlights: in the last five years, sce had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. during the same time period, sce paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, edison international, of approximately $4.8 billion. edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no section vii] =20 viii. earnings of california affiliates sce=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 in 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 this increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. a copy of the report is available on the commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 dan

"in order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," dorinson said. edison international unit (eix) southern california edison, sempra energy unit (sre) san diego gas & electric, pg&e corp. (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. socal edison and pg&e are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. it's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1318gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 dj calif iso, puc inspect off-line duke south bay pwr plant (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--representatives of the california independent system operator and public utilities commission inspected duke energy corp.'s (duk) off-line 700-mw south bay power plant in chula vista, calif., wednesday morning, a duke spokesman said. the iso and puc have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. about 11,000 mw of power has been off the state's power grid since monday, 7,000 mw of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the iso. the iso manages grid reliability. as previously reported, the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst (0100 gmt thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. however, the iso said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc (dyn), reliant energy inc. (rei) and southern energy inc (soe). duke's 1,500-mw moss landing plant was also inspected by puc representatives in june, when some units were off-line for repairs, the duke spokesman said.   -by jessica berthold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1317gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 =dj calif regulators visit aes,dynegy off-line power plants (this article was originally published wednesday)  by jessica berthold of dow jones newswires  los angeles (dow jones)--aes corp. (aes) and dynegy inc. (dyn) said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. the california independent system operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the california public utilities commission began on-site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. the state has had 11,000 mw off the grid since monday, 7,000 mw for unplanned maintenance. the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. as reported earlier, reliant energy (rei) and southern energy inc. (soe) said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening. representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening. aes told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, aes spokesman aaron thomas said. thomas, as well as an iso spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection.  aes units down due to expired emissions credits  the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or nox, emission credits. they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, thomas said. aes has about 2,000 mw, or half its maximum output, off line. the entire huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants. the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations, but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. "we'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," thomas said. "it's not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district's" authority. as reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.  dynegy's el segundo plant also visited by puc  dynegy inc. (dyn) said the puc visited its 1,200 mw el segundo plant tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 mw worth, were off line wednesday. "i guess our position is, 'gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky. lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired.

units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the allen center or met garages are being offered a parking space in the new enron center garage.  this is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. the cost for the new garage will be the same as allen center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.  if you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the enron center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.  the saturn ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. all initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to enron center north until saturn ring access is available. garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.  if you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to parking and transportation as soon as you reach a decision. following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.  the parking and transportation desk may be reached via email at parking and transportation/corp/enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.  (you must enter & exit on clay st. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of bell & smith.)

phillip k allen	ned higgins	2001-04-25 06:52:00	re: this morning's commission meeting delayed	  ned,  regarding the waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  the following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  also an undiscounted  june 01 to january 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning june 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ mmbtu/month ($0.60/year).  demand charges only.  i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  please call or email with comments.  phillip allen 

phillip k allen	nicholasnelson@centurytel.net	2001-04-10 10:51:00	caiso demand reduction	  i will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units.  let me know the day and time.   dave,  the back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped from the office of the chairman.    is your understanding that the west desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.   the office of the chairman agrees to grant origination to the denver desk as follows:  october 2000  $1,395,000 november 2000 $1,350,000 december 2000 $1,395,000 january 2001  $   669,600 february 2001  $   604,800 march 2001  $   669,600 april 2001  $   648,000 may 2001  $   669,600 june 2001  $   648,000 july 2001  $   669,600 august 2001  $   669,600 september 2001 $   648,000 october 2001  $   669,600 november 2001 $   648,000 december 2001 $   669,600  this schedule represents a demand charge payable to nbp energy pipelines by the denver desk.  the demand charge is $.18/mmbtu on 250,000 mmbtu/day (oct-00 thru dec-00) and 120,000 mmbtu/day (jan-01 thru dec-01).  the ena office of the chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.  let me know if you disagree.   larry,  it sounds like claudia and jacques are almost finished with the documents. there is one item of which i was unsure.  was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase?  if yes, shouldn't it be listed as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?   lucy,  the spreadsheet looks fine to me.   bruce,  thank you for your bid.  i have decided on a floor plan.  i am going to have an architect in austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list.  i will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid.  probably in early to mid june.

(i thought his sales price was $187,000.)  at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. what is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  as for rent-ability, i believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    in fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. phillip, i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. sincerely, george w. richards creekside builders, llc

richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 pm please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: "phillip allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "larry lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "claudia l. crocker" <clclegal2@aol.com> subject: investment structure   structure: typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner.  the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  phasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  construction loans there are three types of  construction loans.  first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind?  i would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?"  please expand.  investor input we are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested.  i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.  sincerely,  george richards president, creekside builders, llc     - winmail.dat

phillip k allen	pallen70@hotmail.com	2000-09-26 09:28:00	investment structure	  liane,  as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index.  a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan.  we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27.  these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon).  please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships.  the two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily.  it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.   i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.  it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal.  sincerely,  phillip allen  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 12/06/2000 04:04 pm ---------------------------   "lucy gonzalez" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 12/05/2000 08:34:54 am to: pallen@enron.com cc: subject:    phillip, how are you and how is everyone? i sent you the rent roll #27 is moving out and i wknow that i will be able to rent it real fast.all i have to do in there is touch up the walls .four adults will be moving in @130.00 a wk and 175.00 deposit they will be in by thursday or friday. thank you , lucy    ______________________________________________________________________________ _______ get more from the web.  free msn explorer download : http://explorer.msn.com  - rentroll_1201.xls

phillip k allen	stagecoachmama@hotmail.com	2000-08-24 02:48:00	re: receipts	  bruce,  can you stop by and set up my reuters.   lucy,  the rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  see if you can add these modifications:  1.  use a formula in column e.  add the value in column c to column d.  it should read =c6+d6.  then copy this formula to the rows below.  2.  column h needs a formula.  subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6.  3.  column f is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width is too narrow.  use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter f.  hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.  4.  after we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns j and beyond.

phillip k allen	stagecoachmama@hotmail.com	2001-02-07 06:54:00	re: stage coach	  lucy,  here is the rentroll for this friday.  sorry it is so late.    there are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  i know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. you may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that i don't remember on some of these.  i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit.  will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  tried to call wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  will try again today.  i believe that a doctor from seguin is going to make an offer.  did you meet them?  if so, what did you think? 

phillip k allen	stagecoachmama@hotmail.com	2001-02-09 01:27:00	the stage	  lucy,  here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.  i wrote it as if it were from you.  it should come from the manager.  it is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in.  this needs to be written in on their lease.  when you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  have my dad read the memo before you put it out.   you guys can make changes if you need to.      next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators.  we have to get this done next week.  i will email you a form to use to record serial numbers.  the prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records.  something to look forward to.  it is 2 pm and i have to leave the office.  please have my dad call me with the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  he will know what i mean.  talk to you later, 

phillip k allen	stagecoachmama@hotmail.com	2001-02-14 03:04:00	re:	  forward reg dickson's resume to ted bland for consideration for the trading track program.  he is overqualified and i'm sure too expensive to fill the scheduling position i have available.  i will work with cournie parker to evaluate the other resumes.   lucy,  thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  moving on to 2/9, here are some questions:     #1 it looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  i can't tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit.  #13 i show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.  #15 try and follow up with tomas about the $95.  hopefully, he won't have a bad reaction.  #20b missed rent?  #26  has she paid any deposit or rent?  #27 missed rent?        lee,  my fax number is 713-646-2391.  please fax me a loan application that i can pass on to the buyer.  phillip allen pallen@enron.com  andy,  i spoke to john l. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the west desk.  are there any operational besides ice and dynegy?  if not, can you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.  thank you,   lucy,  here is the 2/2 rentroll.  the total does not equal the bank deposit.  your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.  but the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  if the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back.  now i am going to work on a rentroll for this friday.  i will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  let's get this stuff clean today.

"we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall," said karl karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy. "that is the equivalent of six oil refineries."  a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.  puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. the tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each, karzmar said.  not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting.  for the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue.  on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power -- represent potentially lucrative business customers. the facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.  who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate.  "these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads," said bob royer, director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light.  "the entire university of washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school, averages 31 megawatts per day. we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts."  with more than 1.5 million square feet, the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. sabey corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space & defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.

"it is probably the largest data center park in the country," boasts laurent poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg communications, netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park.  after building exodus' first tukwila facility in 1997, sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country.  as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks such as listening to online music, poole said the need for co-location space in seattle continues to escalate.  but it is not just seattle. the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california.  exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. while companies such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management.  "we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space," said steve porter, an account executive at exodus in seattle.  the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed.  "it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth," said seattle city light's royer. "the utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way."

phillip k allen	vladimir gorny	2000-10-18 03:00:00	re: test	  george,  here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.  check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas:  1.  fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.  2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.  feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   phillip   lucy,  here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  there are alot of overages.  it will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather.  you need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. this needs to be handwritten on all new leases.  i am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  we also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  i will write something today.    wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting.   we do not understand our var.  can you please get us all the detailed reports and component var reports that you can produce?  the sooner the better.
