"in order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation," dorinson said. edison international unit (eix) southern california edison, sempra energy unit (sre) san diego gas & electric, pg&e corp. (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. socal edison and pg&e are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. it's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1318gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 dj calif iso, puc inspect off-line duke south bay pwr plant (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--representatives of the california independent system operator and public utilities commission inspected duke energy corp.'s (duk) off-line 700-mw south bay power plant in chula vista, calif., wednesday morning, a duke spokesman said. the iso and puc have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. about 11,000 mw of power has been off the state's power grid since monday, 7,000 mw of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the iso. the iso manages grid reliability. as previously reported, the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst (0100 gmt thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. however, the iso said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc (dyn), reliant energy inc. (rei) and southern energy inc (soe). duke's 1,500-mw moss landing plant was also inspected by puc representatives in june, when some units were off-line for repairs, the duke spokesman said.   -by jessica berthold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1317gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 =dj calif regulators visit aes,dynegy off-line power plants (this article was originally published wednesday)  by jessica berthold of dow jones newswires  los angeles (dow jones)--aes corp. (aes) and dynegy inc. (dyn) said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. the california independent system operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the california public utilities commission began on-site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. the state has had 11,000 mw off the grid since monday, 7,000 mw for unplanned maintenance. the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. as reported earlier, reliant energy (rei) and southern energy inc. (soe) said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening. representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening. aes told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, aes spokesman aaron thomas said. thomas, as well as an iso spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection.  aes units down due to expired emissions credits  the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or nox, emission credits. they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, thomas said. aes has about 2,000 mw, or half its maximum output, off line. the entire huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants. the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations, but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. "we'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it," thomas said. "it's not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district's" authority. as reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.  dynegy's el segundo plant also visited by puc  dynegy inc. (dyn) said the puc visited its 1,200 mw el segundo plant tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 mw worth, were off line wednesday. "i guess our position is, 'gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky. lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. "we've been doing all we can to get back in service," lednicky said. "we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited." lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. -by jessica berthold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1317gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc   g_nther a. pergher senior analyst dow jones & company inc. tel.  609.520.7067 fax. 609.452.3531  the information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.  any review, retransmission, dissemination or other use of, or taking of any action in reliance upon, this information by persons or entities other than the intended recipient is prohibited. if you received this in error, please contact the sender and delete the material from any computer.       date: thu, 5 oct 2000 06:26:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: david.delainey@enron.com subject: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: david w delainey x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  dave,  here are the names of the west desk members by category.  the origination side is very sparse.      phillip date: thu, 5 oct 2000 05:55:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: paula.harris@enron.com subject: re: 2001 margin plan mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: paula harris x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  paula,  35 million is fine  date: wed, 4 oct 2000 09:23:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: ina.rangel@enron.com subject: var, reporting and resources meeting mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: ina rangel x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 10/04/2000 04:23 pm ---------------------------  enron north america corp.  from:  airam arteaga                           10/04/2000 12:23 pm   to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect, thomas a martin/hou/ect@ect, scott neal/hou/ect@ect, john arnold/hou/ect@ect, grant masson/hou/ect@ect, ted murphy/hou/ect@ect, vladimir gorny/hou/ect@ect, frank hayden/corp/enron@enron cc: rita hennessy/na/enron@enron, ina rangel/hou/ect@ect, laura harder/corp/enron@enron, kimberly brown/hou/ect@ect, araceli romero/na/enron@enron, kimberly hillis/hou/ect@ect subject: var, reporting and resources meeting  please plan to attend the below  meeting:   topic:  var, reporting and resources meeting  date:  wednesday, october 11th  time:  2:30 - 3:30  location: eb30c1    if you have any questions/conflicts, please feel free to call me.  thanks, rain x.31560       date: tue, 3 oct 2000 09:30:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: pallen70@hotmail.com subject: westgate mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: pallen70@hotmail.com x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 10/03/2000 04:30 pm ---------------------------   "george richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 10/03/2000 06:35:56 am please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: "phillip allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "larry lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> subject: westgate   westgate  enclosed are demographics on the westgate site from investor's alliance. investor's alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on san marcos that you received earlier. if there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. then, let me know your interest level in the westgate project?

"we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall," said karl karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy. "that is the equivalent of six oil refineries."  a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.  puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. the tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each, karzmar said.  not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting.  for the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue.  on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power -- represent potentially lucrative business customers. the facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.  who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate.  "these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads," said bob royer, director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light.  "the entire university of washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school, averages 31 megawatts per day. we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts."  with more than 1.5 million square feet, the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. sabey corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space & defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.  "it is probably the largest data center park in the country," boasts laurent poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg communications, netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park.  after building exodus' first tukwila facility in 1997, sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country.  as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks such as listening to online music, poole said the need for co-location space in seattle continues to escalate.  but it is not just seattle. the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california.  exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. while companies such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management.  "we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space," said steve porter, an account executive at exodus in seattle.  the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed.  "it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth," said seattle city light's royer. "the utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way."         date: wed, 6 sep 2000 03:46:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: ina.rangel@enron.com subject: re: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: ina rangel x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ina,  can you pull tori k.'s and martin cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from h.r.  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/06/2000 10:44 am ---------------------------   john j lavorato@enron 09/06/2000 05:39 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re:  the commercial support people that you and hunter want to make commercial managers. date: tue, 5 sep 2000 23:22:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: john.lavorato@enron.com subject: re: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: john j lavorato x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  date: tue, 5 sep 2000 06:51:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: ina.rangel@enron.com subject: re: receipt of team selection form - executive impact & influence program mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: ina rangel x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/05/2000 01:50 pm ---------------------------   "christi smith" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 am please respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com> to: <phillip.k.allen@enron.com> cc: "debbie nowak (e-mail)" <dnowak@enron.com> subject: re: receipt of team selection form - executive impact & influence program   we have not received your completed team selection information.  it is imperative that we receive your team's information (email, phone number, office) asap.  we cannot start your administration without this information, and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.  thank you for your assistance.  christi  -----original message----- from: christi smith [mailto:christi.smith@lrinet.com] sent: thursday, august 31, 2000 10:33 am to: 'phillip.k.allen@enron.com' cc: debbie nowak (e-mail); deborah evans (e-mail) subject: receipt of team selection form - executive impact & influence program importance: high   hi phillip.  we appreciate your prompt attention and completing the team selection information.  ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the team selection form we sent you.  the information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that excel spreadsheet.  if you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information.  we need each person's email address.  without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and id to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email.  it would also be good to have each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.  so, we do need to receive that complete ts excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email.  thank you for your assistance phillip.  christi l. smith project manager for client services keilty, goldsmith & company 858/450-2554  -----original message----- from: phillip k allen [mailto:phillip.k.allen@enron.com] sent: thursday, august 31, 2000 12:03 pm to: debe@fsddatasvc.com subject:     john lavorato-m  mike grigsby-d keith holst-d frank ermis-d steve south-d janie tholt-d  scott neal-p hunter shively-p tom martin-p john arnold-p    date: tue, 5 sep 2000 06:30:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: dexter@intelligencepress.com subject: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: dexter@intelligencepress.com x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/05/2000 01:29 pm ---------------------------    from:  phillip k allen                           08/29/2000 02:20 pm   to: mark@intelligencepress.com cc: subject:  mark,  here is a spreadsheet detailing our september socal trades.

ab 8x and ab 31x.  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  this bill passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support.  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x.  senator  bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy).  according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund.  for instance, tony  strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued. other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday.  additionally, lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.  key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount: $4.125 b lenders:  jp morgan  $2.5 b lehman brothers  $1.0 b bear stearns  $625 m tax exempt portion: of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt projected interest rate: taxable rate  5.77% tax-exempt rate  4.77% current projected blended ir:  5.38% maturity date:  august 29, 2001 for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority.    the $5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  again, the republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power.    also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the california public power and conservation authority.  however, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis.  socal edison and bankruptcy at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy.  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor.  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it.  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass.  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  in other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy.  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments.  date: fri, 4 may 2001 05:18:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, jane.tholt@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com, tori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com subject: re: western wholesale activities - gas & power conf. call mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain;

owa please print this now.   current notes user:  reasons for using outlook web access (owa)  1. once your mailbox has been migrated from notes to outlook, the outlook client will be configured on your computer. after migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via notes, and you will not be able to start using outlook until it is configured by the outlook migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  during this period, you can use outlook web access (owa) via your web browser (internet explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  please note:  your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and to-do entries imported from notes will not be available until the outlook client is configured on your desktop.  2. remote access to your mailbox. after your outlook client is configured, you can use outlook web access (owa) for remote access to your mailbox.  please note:  at this time, the owa client is only accessible while connecting to the enron network (lan).  there are future plans to make owa available from your home or when traveling abroad.  how to access outlook web access (owa)  launch internet explorer 5.0, and in the address window type: http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click enter.  you will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your nt password to logon to owa and click ok.  you will now be able to view your mailbox.    please note:  there are some subtle differences in the functionality between the outlook and owa clients.  you will not be able to do many of the things in owa that you can do in outlook.  below is a brief list of *some* of the functions not available via owa:  features not available using owa:  -  tasks -  journal -  spell checker -  offline use -  printing templates -  reminders -  timed delivery -  expiration -  outlook rules -  voting, message flags and message recall -  sharing contacts with others -  task delegation -  direct resource booking -  personal distribution lists  questions or concerns?  if you have questions or concerns using the owa client, please contact the outlook 2000 question and answer mailbox at:  outlook.2000@enron.com  otherwise, you may contact the resolution center at:  713-853-1411  thank you,  outlook 2000 migration team date: tue, 1 may 2001 07:14:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: ina.rangel@enron.com subject: 2- survey/information email mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: ina rangel x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_june2001\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 05/01/2001 02:14 pm ---------------------------   outlook migration team@enron 04/27/2001 01:00 pm to: allison horton/na/enron@enron, amir baig/na/enron@enron, brandon bangerter/na/enron@enron, brian ellis/corp/enron@enron, charles philpott/hr/corp/enron@enron, chris p wood/na/enron@enron, chris tull/hou/ect@ect, dale smith/corp/enron@enron, dave june/na/enron@enron, donald sutton/na/enron@enron, felicia buenrostro/hr/corp/enron@enron, johnna morrison/corp/enron@enron, joe dorn/corp/enron@enron, kathryn schultea/hr/corp/enron@enron, leon mcdowell/na/enron@enron, leticia barrios/corp/enron@enron, milton brown/hr/corp/enron@enron, raj perubhatla/corp/enron@enron, shekar komatireddy/na/enron@enron, andrea yowman/corp/enron@enron, angie o'brian/hr/corp/enron@enron, bonne castellano/hr/corp/enron@enron, gwynn gorsuch/na/enron@enron, jo ann matson/corp/enron@enron, laquitta washington/hr/corp/enron@enron, rick johnson/hr/corp/enron@enron, sandra lighthill/hr/corp/enron@enron, valeria a hope/hou/ect@ect, charlotte brown/hr/corp/enron@enron, ronald fain/hr/corp/enron@enron, gary fitch/hr/corp/enron@enron, anna harris/hr/corp/enron@enron, keith jones/hr/corp/enron@enron, kristi monson/na/enron@enron, bobbie mcniel/hr/corp/enron@enron, john stabler/hr/corp/enron@enron, michelle prince/na/enron@enron, james gramke/na/enron@enron, blair hicks/na/enron@enron, jennifer johnson/contractor/enron communications@enron communications, jim little/enron@enronxgate, dale lukert/na/enron@enron, donald martin/na/enron@enron, andrew mattei/na/enron@enron, darvin mitchell/na/enron@enron, mark oldham/na/enron@enron, wesley pearson/na/enron@enron, ramon pizarro/enron_development@enron_development, natalie rau/na/enron@enron, william redick/na/enron@enron, mark a richardson/na/enron@enron, joseph schnieders/na/enron@enron, gary simmons/na/enron@enron, delaney trimble/na/enron@enron, david upton/na/enron@enron, mike boegler/hr/corp/enron@enron, lyndel click/hr/corp/enron@enron, gabriel franco/na/enron@enron, randy gross/hr/corp/enron@enron, arthur johnson/hr/corp/enron@enron, danny jones/hr/corp/enron@enron, john ogden/houston/eott@eott, edgar ponce/na/enron@enron, tracy pursifull/hr/corp/enron@enron, lance stanley/hr/corp/enron@enron, frank ermis/hou/ect@ect, jane m tholt/hou/ect@ect, jay reitmeyer/hou/ect@ect, keith holst/hou/ect@ect, matthew lenhart/hou/ect@ect, mike grigsby/hou/ect@ect, monique sanchez/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect, randall l gay/hou/ect@ect, tori kuykendall/hou/ect@ect, brenda h fletcher/hou/ect@ect, jeanne wukasch/corp/enron@enron, mary theresa franklin/hou/ect@ect, mike potter/na/enron@enron, natalie baker/hou/ect@ect, suzanne calcagno/na/enron@enron, alvin thompson/corp/enron@enron, cynthia franklin/corp/enron@enron, jesse villarreal/hou/ect@ect, joan collins/hou/ees@ees, joe a casas/hou/ect@ect, kelly loocke/enron@enronxgate, lia halstead/na/enron@enron, meredith homco/hou/ect@ect, robert allwein/hou/ect@ect, scott loving/na/enron@enron, shanna boudreaux/enron@enronxgate, steve gillespie/corp/enron@enron, tamara carter/na/enron@enron, tracy wood/na/enron@enron, gabriel fuzat/enron communications@enron communications, jack netek/enron communications@enron communications, lam nguyen/na/enron@enron, camille gerard/corp/enron@enron, craig taylor/hou/ect@ect, jessica hangach/nyc/mgusa@mgusa, kathy gagel/nyc/mgusa@mgusa, lisa goulart/nyc/mgusa@mgusa, ruth balladares/nyc/mgusa@mgusa, sid strutt/nyc/mgusa@mgusa cc: subject: 2- survey/information email  current notes user:  to ensure that you experience a successful migration from notes to outlook, it is necessary to gather individual user information prior to your date of migration.  please take a few minutes to completely fill out the following survey.  when you finish, simply click on the 'reply' button then hit 'send' your survey will automatically be sent to the outlook 2000 migration mailbox.  thank you.  outlook 2000 migration team  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------  full name:  login id:  extension:  office location:  what type of computer do you have?

 i think $100 should be enough.  use page setup under the file menu to change  from portrait to landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally.  also try selecting fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page.  use print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.  the truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  a valve adjustment might do some good.  it has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.  glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  great job on february.  date: fri, 3 mar 2000 04:48:00 -0800 (pst) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: jim.brysch@enron.com subject: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: jim brysch x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  date: fri, 3 mar 2000 04:33:00 -0800 (pst) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: mike.grigsby@enron.com subject: western strategy summaries mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: mike grigsby x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/03/2000 12:30 pm ---------------------------   tim heizenrader 03/03/2000 07:25 am to: james b fallon/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: western strategy summaries  slides from yesterday's meeting are attached: date: fri, 3 mar 2000 02:53:00 -0800 (pst) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: maryrichards7@hotmail.com subject: re: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: "mary richards" <maryrichards7@hotmail.com> @ enron x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  it is ok to let the deposit rollover on #13 if there is no interruption in date: fri, 3 nov 2000 07:43:00 -0800 (pst) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: pallen70@hotmail.com subject: allen durango hotel ------- 48 hr cancel mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: pallen70@hotmail.com x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_dec2000\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 11/03/2000 03:45 pm ---------------------------   ina rangel 11/03/2000 11:53 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: allen durango hotel ------- 48 hr cancel  phillip,  here is your hotel itinerary for monday night.  -ina ---------------------- forwarded by ina rangel/hou/ect on 11/03/2000 01:53 pm ---------------------------   sherri sorrels <ssorrels_vitoltvl@yahoo.com> on 11/03/2000 01:52:21 pm to: ina.rangel@enron.com cc: subject: allen durango hotel ------- 48 hr cancel   sales agt: js/zbatud  allen/phillip   enron 1400 smith houston tx 77002 ina rangel x37257   date:  nov 03 2000                   enron    hotel                 06nov doubletree durango 07nov 501 camino del rio durango, co 81301 telephone: (970) 259-6580 confirmation: 85110885 reference: d1krac rate: rac usd 89.00 per night ght additional charges may apply   invoice total                  0    thank you *********************************************** **48 hr cancellation required** thank you for calling vitol travel   __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!?

got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  he took my plan and improved it.  i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans.  while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list.  also, i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  i will be in san marcos on friday april 13th.  are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day?  also can you provide some references?  once i have the plans and specs, i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.  date: wed, 4 apr

units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the allen center or met garages are being offered a parking space in the new enron center garage.  this is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. the cost for the new garage will be the same as allen center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.  if you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the enron center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.  the saturn ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. all initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to enron center north until saturn ring access is available. garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.  if you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to parking and transportation as soon as you reach a decision. following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.  the parking and transportation desk may be reached via email at parking and transportation/corp/enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.  (you must enter & exit on clay st. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of bell & smith.)          date: mon, 2 apr 2001 05:52:00 -0700 (pdt) from: phillip.allen@enron.com to: pallen70@hotmail.com subject: mime-version: 1.0 content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii content-transfer-encoding: 7bit x-from: phillip k allen x-to: pallen70@hotmail.com x-cc: x-bcc: x-folder: \phillip_allen_june2001\notes folders\sent x-origin: allen-p  date: thu, 29 mar 2001 04:01:00 -0800 (pst)
